function[v1, v2, v3, M, M_9x15, v_M_Product, M_v_Product, M_M_Product, M_M_componentwise, crossP, dotP] = MatlabBasics()
%% General Hints:
% If you want to check your implementation you can:
% -) Set a breakpoint to access variables at a certain point in the 
% script. You can inspect their contents in the 'Workspace' window
% (The 'Workspace' window is usually on the right side of Matlab. 
%  If it is hidden, you can open it in the menu: Home/Environment/Layout/Show/Workspace).
% -) Leave out the ';' at the end of a statement/line so the result will be
% printed out in the command window.
% -) Do not rename the predefined variables, or else our test-system won't
% work (which is bad for both parties ;) )
%% I. create basic data structures:
% 1) create a Row Vector 'v1' and a Column Vector 'v2' with 3 Elements and a 3by3 Matrix 'M' 
% containing digits of your matriculation number in the following order:
% matriculation number: 'ABCDEFG'
% Vector: 
% v1 =
%      F     B     E  
% v2 = 
%      G
%      C
%      D
% Matrix:
% M = 
%      C     B     G
%      F     D     B
%      E     C     A

v1 = [9, 5, 1];
v2 = [3; 2; 7]; % TODO: edit this
M = [2, 5, 3; 9, 7, 5; 1, 2, 1]; % TODO: edit this

% 2) create a sequence: create a Vector 'v3' with elements starting at the
% largest digit of M to the smallest, each element 0.5 less than the one
% before. Use the sequence operator ':' and Matlab's
% min/max functions to accomplish this.
% !Use the matrix M for this task and not the same numbers as in M!
% Example: The matriculation number 1210233 should give you the following vector:
% v3 =
%       3  2.5  2  1.5  1  0.5  0
% for more information on how to use the sequence operator ':' (as well as 
% all other Matlab functions), type (in the matlab commandline):
% help :

v3 = max(M):-0.5:min(M); % TODO: edit this

% 3) create a 9-by-15 Matrix 'M_9x15' containing a checkerboard pattern of 
% tiles where each black tile contains the contents of matrix M and 
% every white tile contains zeros. Each tile, black or white, has the size 3x3.
% The corners must be black (i.e. contain M).
% ( You have to accomplish this task using a maximum of 7
% assignment-commands.
% Commands that use the = operator for assignment (not comparison) are
% counted as assignment-commands.
% You have to reuse M and you must not use loops.
% For more information see 
% http://de.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matrices-and-arrays.html
% and
% http://de.mathworks.com/help/matlab/math/matrix-indexing.html
% and have a look at the zeros-command:
% help zeros

M_9x15 = 0; % TODO: edit this

%% II. implement your own versions of the following built-in Matlab functions:
% *, .*, cross, dot

% ATTENTION: of course you are not allowed to use the function 'cross' or
% 'dot' as well as '.*' for this task. Furthermore you may only use 
% the '*' operator on single components (-> multiply one element of a 
% matrix or a vector with one other element). You may (and will probably)
% use loops.

% Hint: In order to check your solution, you can compare your results with
% the results you get by using the built-in Matlab functions.

% 1) Vector-Matrix-Multiplication (use v1 and M)
v_M_Product = vector_X_Matrix(v1, M);

% 2) Matrix-Vector-Multiplication (use M and v2)
M_v_Product = Matrix_X_vector(M, v2);

% 3) Matrix-Matrix-Multiplication 
% (use M and the transposed Matrix M2) 
M2 = M';
M_M_Product = Matrix_X_Matrix(M, M2);

% 4) Matrix-Matrix-Multiplication component wise
% (use M and M2 and implement component wise matrix multiplication)
M_M_componentwise = Matrix_Xc_Matrix(M, M2);

% 5) cross product of 2 vectors (use v1 and v2)
crossP = crossProduct(v1,v2);

% 6) dot product (use v1 and v2)
dotP = dotProduct(v1,v2);


end

function[result] = vector_X_Matrix(v1, M)

% return a row vector
for R = 1:size(M)
    r
end
% TODO: your code goes here
result = 0; % TODO: edit this

end

function[result] = Matrix_X_vector(M, v2)

%return a column vector

% TODO: your code goes here
result = 0; % TODO: edit this

end

function[result] = Matrix_X_Matrix(M, M2)

% hint: row times column!

% TODO: your code goes here
result = 0; % TODO: edit this

end

function[result] = Matrix_Xc_Matrix(M, M2)

% implement component wise multiplication

% TODO: your code goes here
result = 0; % TODO: edit this

end

function[result] = crossProduct(v1,v2)

% IMPORTANT: DON'T use the built-in Matlab function 'cross' to do this!!!
% implement it yourself and then compare it with 'cross'

% return a row vector

% TODO: your code goes here
result = 0; % TODO: edit this

end

function[result] = dotProduct(v1,v2)

% IMPORTANT: DON'T use the built in Matlab function 'dot' to do this!!!
% implement it yourself and then compare it with 'dot'

% TODO: your code goes here
result = 0; % TODO: edit this

end
